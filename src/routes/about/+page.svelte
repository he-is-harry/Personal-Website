    <h2>Harry has been creating code for 7 years.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Ever since learning Swift with Apple in Swift Playgrounds in 2017, Harry has envisioned, launched, and built a number of projects. He's a full stack developer, game designer, and teacher. In 2018, Harry started studying competitive programming by learning Java and preparing for the Canadian Computing Compeition. From there, he started learning algorithms and data structures and picked up two other languages, Python and C++, all the way throughout middle school and highschool going all the way up to learning advanced topics such as persistent data structures and CDQ divide and conquer.</p>

    <p>In 2020, Harry developed a replica of Wii Sports Tennis which earned him a mark of 100% in his grade 10 computer science course. Later on, in 2021 and 2022, he continued developing games creating his own random terrain generation technique and pixel art methodology. At the same time, Harry became interested in a field which he continues to study: Artificial Intelligence. He created his own Chess AI, a doodle classifier, and a neuroevolution flappy bird game to advance his knowledge into machine learning and its applications.</p>

    <p>Harry is continuing his journey by going on to study Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. He continues to broaden his understanding of computer science by studying front end development and networking. As this website built in 2023 is one of Harry's projects where the site is coded in SvelteKit. Harry's hobbies include learning about quantum chromodynamics and running with his family.</p>
